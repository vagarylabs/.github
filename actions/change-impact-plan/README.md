# Change-impact planner

This deterministic action uses immutable candidate inputs and trusted base policy to describe affected work. Pin the action to a reviewed commit. The caller remains responsible for its complete validation obligations and final required verdict.

## Cumulative impact record

Planner 1.3 adds `plan.impact` (schema 1). It reuses the existing path ownership and reverse-dependency computation. It does not change merge-group jobs or matrices: those still select FULL validation, and this action does not authorize run-result reuse.

- `selection_authority` is always `false`.
- `status: known` means modeled impact under a matched supported-static-reader assessment, not complete reader qualification or approval to omit tests.
- `status: unknown` uses `null` for changed packages, affected packages and affected hubs. It must not be interpreted as an empty affected set.
- Global or unmapped inputs, absent or moved targets, missing policy and missing or malformed reader evidence remain unknown.
- An inert-only change may have known empty modeled impact; its merge-group execution still remains FULL.

The record includes the graph digest, reader assessment and coverage limits, changed/global/unmapped inputs, and immutable candidate, target, policy, source and producer-attempt identities. Its entire versioned content is bound into `plan_id`.

The reader assessment must cover the configured reader directories and bind the actual candidate, policy, graph and scanner. It covers only supported static expressions. Consumers need their own qualified complete obligation inventory, trustworthy execution receipts and enforced policy boundary before enabling any new selection.

## Source answer (1.4)

Planner 1.4 adds `source_answer` and `source_answer_meta` to every record; both are bound into `plan_id`.

- `source_answer` follows the SRC-01 source-context envelope (vagary-core `contracts/source/v1`, pinned in `plan.SOURCE_CONTRACT`). It covers repository identity (provider-stable `github.repository_id` and owner id), the pinned diff base and candidate SHAs, the analyzer (`ci.change-impact-plan` + version), how the candidate was materialized (history depth, clone filter and sparse patterns recorded independently, plus the policy files actually read), and completeness.
- `authorization` is deliberately absent. A CI job token is not a source-access grant. Consumers must obtain the canonical `authorize()` result themselves and must not treat this envelope as authorized.
- Completeness is derived, never asserted. Each of the following makes it partial or unknown, which makes the plan **FULL**:
  - unknown or moved scope;
  - a truncated path list;
  - an absent, unbound or unmatched reader assessment;
  - a base policy checkout that does not match the base tree byte for byte (for example, a sparse checkout missing a tracked manifest, lockfile, workflow or config);
  - an `analyzer` pin in the base policy that differs from this planner;
  - missing provider identity;
  - an unobservable checkout representation;
  - a provider witness that is capped, throttled, malformed or disagrees with Git.
- `source_answer_meta.decision` is `IMPACT_INPUT` only when every dimension is complete. It never grants selection, qualification or release authority.
- With no observed source facts, a library call to `plan()` also returns FULL.
- `source-query: witness` (default `off`) asks the provider's compare API at the pinned SHAs using this action's token.
  - It sends one request, refuses pagination and redirects, and caps the response at 8 MiB and 15 s.
  - A comparison with 300 or more files, or more than 100 commits, counts as incomplete. These caps mirror the existing Vagaris reader.
  - The witness can only widen a plan. Provider bodies and tokens are never recorded.

Callers that adopt 1.4 must update any recomputed `plan_id` identity: it now includes `impact`, `source` and `source_meta`.

## Reader scan (1.4.1)

`edges.py` classifies every workspace-root literal: `"services"`, `"apps"`, ..., also `"./services"`, `"services/"` and a
backtick string with no substitution. It works from the WHOLE file's tokens: strings, comments, regex literals, and
brackets across lines. Lines are split on `\n` only, as `git grep` numbers them.

The rule is root's principle (2026-10-26): **metadata needs positive evidence; everything else refuses.** A refusal plans
FULL.

1. **A read, in a path.** The literal reads a path when it is:
   - after a pathlib `/`;
   - ALONE as an argument of `join`, `resolve`, `joinpath` or `Path(...)`;
   - in a list spread into one (`*[...]`, `...[...]`);
   - the sole argument of `sep.join(...)`;
   - or `[...].join(...)`-ed.

   Then:
   - The literal components that follow are joined, and the owning package is read.
   - A computed or glob component (`*`, `?`, `[`, `{`), or a walk of the result (`glob`, `rglob`, `iterdir`,
     `os.walk`, `readdir`, ...), also reads every package beneath the literal prefix.
   - A parent step after the root REFUSES: `..`, `.parent`, `os.pardir` or `dirname(...)`. It counts in the root's own
     argument, in a later argument of an enclosing path call, in a call around it, and later in its statement (nested
     blocks and objects excepted).
   - An unowned path normally needs no edge, because its change plans FULL. If the caller's `inert_globs` or
     `extra_edges` cover it, that no longer holds, so the read REFUSES.
2. **A read, as a walker.** These read every package beneath the root:
   - a collection holding only the root;
   - a loop over a collection holding it, or over pairs that hold it;
   - a method called on such a collection.

   A root named INSIDE a string also reads every package beneath its literal prefix, unless a `..` follows in the same
   path run. That covers an f-string, a template, a glob, SQL text or prose: `f"{ROOT}/services/{x}"`,
   `"services/*/migrations"`.

   A substitution is opaque, so a computed string REFUSES when it holds a parent step anywhere (`..`, `pardir`,
   `parent`, `dirname`) or nests code naming a root: `f"{os.path.join(ROOT, 'services', x, '..')}"`.

   In a plain string, a root starts a path in two places:
   - where no `/` precedes it, so `backend/services/` and a route `/:org/services/:id` are not repo-root paths;
   - at the very start, after leading slashes, when no component follows (`ROOT + "/services/" + x`).

   A backslash separates when doubled, in a raw string, or before a character that makes no escape: `\d` keeps its
   backslash, while `\n` is an escape.

   A string that is a statement by itself (a docstring, or a JS directive) is never consumed, so it reads nothing.
   The exception is a doctest (`>>>`) that names a root: that is executed code, so it REFUSES.
3. **Metadata, only with positive evidence:**
   - an object key or value, never a ternary branch;
   - a subscript key (`m["services"]`);
   - a comparison (`==`, `===`, `in`, `not in`, `case`), also inside a comprehension, which is never a literal
     collection;
   - any `.sql` file;
   - a list, tuple or set of literals that is assigned in a statement (`ROOTS = (...)`), an object value, compared, or
     nested in such a collection. Even then, a sibling naming a package (`("services", "b")`) or a package-owning
     top-level directory (`("services", "packages")`) is read.
4. **Everything else REFUSES**, including:
   - a root not alone in a path argument (`"services" + os.sep + x`, `"apps" if web else "services"`);
   - a subscripted list in a path call;
   - a direct argument of any other call (`make("services", v=1)`, `shutil.copytree("services", ...)`,
     `pytest.main(["services"])`). There is deliberately no allowlist of metadata calls; a caller rewrites such a line
     as a literal or a named constant;
   - a keyword argument or default parameter;
   - a bare assignment (`kind = "services"`);
   - an argv element of an exec call, or its options;
   - a root inside a regex literal;
   - any file whose brackets do not close;
   - any file type the tokenizer does not parse. Only Python, JS/TS and JSON are parsed; `.sql` is metadata.

The workspace manifest `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines the graph, so it is not scanned. A change to it already plans FULL.

`test_edges_review_vectors.json` holds the 124 adversarial readers from root's two independent reviews. Each one reads its
truth or refuses, except five residuals that root's 2026-10-26 metadata ruling accepts: an object value or key, or an
assigned label list, later used as a path. The scanner reads lexically and does not follow a value through variables.

## Compatibility and validation

Legacy `mode`, `run` and `matrices` behavior is preserved. Disabling reader checks does not authorize narrower validation. Existing callers must explicitly adopt the new immutable version; changing this repository does not migrate their pins.

The existing public CI workflow runs planner regressions, asset-fetch controls and workflow lint. Existing GitHub-managed CodeQL remains separate. These results qualify the tested shared component; they do not prove a private consumer's coverage, merge safety or release readiness.

On the approved POSIX/Linux runner path, the optional provider witness executes its single GET in an owned Python worker. Windows selectors do not support these process pipes; failure remains UNKNOWN/FULL. The parent enforces the existing whole-request deadline across process startup, DNS, connect, TLS, status/headers and body, and kills/reaps the worker on timeout, output overflow or catchable interruption (at most one additional second for reaping). Request credentials travel only through a private stdin pipe, not argv or inherited GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN; worker stderr and exception details are not logged. Response metadata and body are capped separately. This changes transport containment, not source-access authority or plan-selection permissions. Malformed non-string provider file statuses remain UNKNOWN/FULL rather than raising an uncaught type error.

Abrupt parent termination (including default SIGTERM/SIGKILL) is outside Python exception cleanup; the runner must own and reap the complete job process group. This transport does not install a process-global signal handler or claim standalone orphan recovery after abrupt parent death.
